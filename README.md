# Bolleonsdag
Every Wednesday is bolleonsdag. It can be easy to forget which day it is and therefore we want to automatically send an iMessage to all participants.

## Setup
To get started first make sure you are using a mac and is signed in to your iCloud account. You also need to pair your iPhone with your mac to send iMessages.

1. Clone this repository into your favorite folder
2. Make sure that all the receivers in the list of receivers is in your iCloud contacts.
3. Run bolleonsdag.py 

## Automatic scheduling of the script
Using the calendar application you can run an automator task when an calendar event is firing. Make the automator task run bolleonsdag.py.
